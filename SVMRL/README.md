## Spatial branching for a special class of convex MIQPs

Here are the instances from the paper "Spatial branching for a special class of convex MIQPs" by P. Belotti. Format is as follows:

* line 1: $d$ (number of dimensions)
* line 2: $n$ (number of points)
* line 3: value of $C$
* line 4: initial lower/upper bound on all $w$ variables (coefficients)
* line 5: initial lower/upper bound on $b$ (right-hand side)
* lines 6-following: vector ${\mathbf x}_i$, scalar $y_i$ for i=1..n
